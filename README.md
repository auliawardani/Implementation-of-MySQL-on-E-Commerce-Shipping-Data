# Implementation of MySQL on E-Commerce Shipping Data
In this project, the implementation of Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) syntax in MySQL was used to efficiently manage and organize product delivery information. DDL was used to create the database structure, such as tables to store shipping data, while DML was used to manage the data, such as adding, deleting, or modifying shipping entries. By using DDL and DML, shipping data could be well-organized, facilitating the management and processing of shipping information.
Additionally, by using Advanced Query on the top 30 data, companies can gain valuable insights that can be used to improve the efficiency and quality of their shipping services.
